== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Why do I need this plugin?**

Because there's no native way to send subscribers from Elementor Pro form widget to Sendy, so if you want to avoid modifying your Functions.php to achieve this, you can just install Sendy Elements with a couple of clicks.

**Why is Elementor Pro required?**

Because this integration works with the Form Widget, which is a Elementor Pro unique feature not available in the free plugin.

**Can I still use other integrations if I install Sendy Elements?**

Yes, all the other form widget integrations will be available. You can even use more than one at the same time per form.

**Do I need to know how to code to use Sendy Elements?**

No, you don't and that's the main reason that I created this plugin, so you can integrate both Sendy and Elementor without knowing how to code.


== Screenshots ==

1. **Select from the Dropdown.** Just select Sendy from the "Actions After Submit" dropdown in the form widget.
2. **Sendy List ID.** You can find the list ID in your Sendy Lists dashboard.
3. **Sendy URL.** This is the domain where you installed Sendy. It must finish with /
